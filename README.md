# FindLostPhone Project

## Overview
This project aims to locate a lost phone using the data from three different stations. Each station provides distance information to the phone, but they are subjected to various types of noise. 

## Methodology
We employ the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, a nonlinear local optimization technique, to accurately estimate the phone's position despite the noise in the data.

## Repository Contents
- MATLAB code implementing the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
-  [FindLostPhone Methodology (PDF)](vaja1_IS.pdf): A detailed document explaining the theoretical background and implementation details.
